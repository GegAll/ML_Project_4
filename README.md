# ML_Project_4

Approches:
SFA -> HSFA
find a spacial representation for robot position and orientation
record new data and save the images and the positions and orientation of the robot 
find optimal dimension of spatial representation
fit a function to map representation to x,y and phi
visualization of the representation vs x,y and phi
